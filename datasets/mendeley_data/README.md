# Mendeley Chest X-ray Dataset

## Data Partitioning Strategy

The pre-existing train-test split provided with the dataset was retained. Additionally, an internal validation set was created by allocating **10% of the training data**, resulting in a three-way partition:

- **Training set**
- **Validation set** (10% of training)
- **Test set**
